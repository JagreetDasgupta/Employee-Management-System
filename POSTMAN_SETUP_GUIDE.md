## Step 4: Manual Testing Tips

### Testing Different Scenarios

### Environment Variables

The collection automatically manages these variables:
- `token`: Current user's JWT token
- `admin_token`: Admin user's JWT token
- `hr_token`: HR user's JWT token
- `user_role`: Current user's role
- `base_url`: API base URL (http://localhost:3000)

### Response Validation

Check these in each response:
- **Status Code**: Should match expected HTTP status
- **Response Body**: Should contain expected data structure
- **Headers**: Should include proper content-type
- **Error Messages**: Should be descriptive for failed requests

## Step 5: Advanced Testing

### Bulk Operations
You can also test the bulk operations using the scripts in your project:
```bash
node scripts/addBulkEmployees.js
node test_enhanced_api.js
```

### Performance Testing
- Use Postman's "Runner" feature to test multiple requests
- Monitor response times
- Test with different data sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server Not Running**:
   - Error: "Could not get any response"
   - Solution: Start server with `npm start`

2. **CORS Issues**:
   - Error: CORS policy errors
   - Solution: Check server CORS configuration

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Error: Database connection failed
   - Solution: Check MongoDB connection string

4. **Token Expired**:
   - Error: 401 Unauthorized
   - Solution: Re-login to get fresh token

### Debug Tips

1. **Check Console Logs**: Monitor your server console for errors
2. **Use Postman Console**: View detailed request/response logs
3. **Test Individual Endpoints**: Start with simple GET requests
4. **Verify Environment**: Ensure correct environment is selected

## Success Criteria

Your API is working correctly if:
- âœ… All authentication endpoints return proper responses
- âœ… CRUD operations work for employees
- âœ… Advanced features (filtering, pagination, sorting) work
- âœ… Analytics endpoints return data
- âœ… Role-based access control works properly
- âœ… Error handling works for invalid requests

## Next Steps

After successful Postman testing:
1. Test the React frontend
2. Run the automated test scripts
3. Document any issues found
4. Prepare for demonstration

Happy Testing! ðŸš€
